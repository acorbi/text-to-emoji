# text-to-emoji

My friend Maik uses the language of emojis wonderfully when communicating over social messengers.

This little HTML/JS page, inspired by him, translates short sentences into strings of visual characters. Works 100% locally.

Thanks for your creativity, dear Maik 🙏🏻 ❤️ 🤗

For testing it, download the `text-to-emoji.html` file and open it on your computer.
